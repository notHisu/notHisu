## About Me

> ah 8 hours sleep is a myth, depression is real, and caffeine is my only friend - Michael

I'm a 4th-year IT student currently speedrunning my way straight into unemployment. I write code that occasionally works on the first try (those are good days), but mostly I'm just moving bugs around like I'm playing whack-a-mole with my codebase.

When I'm not fighting with my IDE or Googling "why doesn't this work" for the 49th time today, you'll find me watching anime and pretending that fictional characters have their lives more together than I do.

Technical interviews give me the kind of existential dread usually reserved for people watching their prod server go down at 3 AM. My commit history reads like a psychological thriller with plot twists nobody asked for, and my rubber duck has filed for emotional damages after listening to me explain why my recursive function caused a stack overflow... again.

Currently preparing myself for the thrilling adventure of explaining to recruiters why my GitHub contributions graph looks like a barcode scanner had a seizure.
