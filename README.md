## About Me

> ah 8 hours sleep is a myth, depression is real, and caffeine is my only friend - Michael

I’m a 4th-year IT student navigating the chaos of learning to code while simultaneously questioning all my life choices. My code works on the first try about 10% of the time, and the other 90% is spent debugging issues I created five minutes ago.

When I’m not coding, I’m watching anime and marveling at how fictional characters somehow have better project management skills than I do. My IDE and I share a love-hate relationship—where the hate is mutual—and my search history is 90% Stack Overflow links with increasingly desperate queries.

Technical interviews trigger the same fight-or-flight response most people reserve for actual emergencies. My commit messages tell a story of confusion, hope, and eventual acceptance that nothing will ever work as intended. Somewhere out there, my rubber duck is in therapy because of me.

My GitHub contributions graph looks like someone spilled coffee on a spreadsheet, but I’m still here—still learning—and still convinced that one day I’ll write code that doesn’t make senior developers weep. Currently preparing to explain to future employers why passion and perseverance should count for something, even when your code doesn’t compile.
